## Redesign and Build Marbledfabrics.com

## Motivation

The current Marbledfabrics.com was created around 2005 using Drupal/Ubercart, replacing an existing OSCommerce site. It is a full shopping cart system, and handles credit card information.

Over the years, the site has proven useful as a product showcase, but most customers have actually placed their orders over the phone.

In summary, the existing site:

 - is rather complex relative to actual usage
 - handles payment information, necessitating regular maintenance:
  - security updates
  - hosting costs
  - SSL certificate renewal

## Proposal

This proposal is about building a new Marbledfabrics.com, with the following features:

 - Articles about Marji's process, history, ways customers have used her fabrics, etc
 - Gallery of fabric colors and textures
 - Instructions for submitting an order via phone or email
 
This new site would not support online ordering, which would allow it to be built as a static site, hosted for free on Github Pages, and would eliminate the need for an SSL certificate.

## Timeline

The site build will proceed in three deliverable phases, each followed by a single round of feedback/revision:

### Preliminary design elements

 - initial design elements
   - color palette
   - font faces
 - a site map listing each planned page/section as a tree
 - a simple one or two page site containing the above elements, built using the same tools as the final site.

### Draft

 - Basic page layout
 - Color palette applied throughout (headings, backgrounds, links, etc)
 - A gallery of fabric sample images
 - Articles ported from existing site
 - Contact page
   - Simple subject/body/email form
   - Phone/address
   - Instructions for placing an order

### Publish

 - Finalized layout
 - Finalized site copy
 - Publish site at http://marbledfabrics.com
 - Discontinue existing hosting
