  <p>I use 100% cotton. My dyeing and cleaning process ensures that the fabric is pre-shrunk and washable. I suggest washing the fabric by hand using mild soap or machine washing it on a gentle cycle. If you plan to use any fabric with dark background in a quilt or garment with light fabrics, always rinse first until water runs clear. Dry fabric in the dryer, and iron the reverse side on medium heat.</p>
