#Overview
Rebuild of http://www.marbledfabrics.com 

The current site is on an outdated Drupal platform and is not responsive/mobile friendly. The client has indicated they want to update the site and no longer has the need for a CMS or ecommerce capability. The new site will be built using Jekyll, look better on mobile devices, and be served up as a static website.
